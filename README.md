# Music Genre Classification using LIME

This project demonstrates how to use LIME to explain the predictions of a neural network trained on a music genre classification task. The goal of the project is to improve the interpretability of the neural network and gain insights into how it is making predictions.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) can be used to improve the interpretability of a neural network trained on a music genre classification task. The specific objectives are as follows:

1. Train a neural network on the music lyrics data to classify songs into different genres. This objective involves the following steps:

    **a.** Prepare the data and split it into training and testing sets.

    **b.** Define the architecture of the neural network and compile it.

    **c.** Train the neural network on the training set.

    **d.** Evaluate the performance of the neural network on the testing set.

2. Use LIME to generate local explanations for individual predictions of the neural network. This objective involves the following steps:

    **a.** Load the trained neural network.

    **b.** Define a preprocessing function and a prediction function for the neural network.

    **c.** Define the LIME explainer and the segmentation function to be used by LIME.

    **d.** Generate a local explanation for an individual prediction using the explainer.

3. Use the local explanations to gain insights into how the neural network is making predictions. This objective involves the following steps:

    **a.** Analyze the local explanations to identify important features and patterns.

    **b.** Use the insights gained from the local explanations to improve the interpretability and performance of the neural network.

    **c.** Iterate on the process of training the neural network and using LIME to generate local explanations until a satisfactory level of performance and interpretability is achieved.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to demonstrate how LIME can be used to improve the interpretability and performance of a neural network trained on a music genre classification task, and to provide insights into how the neural network is making predictions.
